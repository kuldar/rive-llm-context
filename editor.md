## Editor menu

The Editor menu is located to the left of the Transform Tools menu. This menu gives you access to a number of file level options including revision history, export options, ways to share your file, render options, sounds, and shortcuts.

![Filemenu Pn](/images/filemenu.png)

**Revision History**

Rive automatically saves your revision history. You can view your view or reinstate any instance of your files revision history through the revision history option.

![Revision Pn](/images/revision.png)

Additionally, you can create a new, custom revision using the Create Revision option.

Read more about revision history [here](http://rive.app/docs/editor/fundamentals/revision-history).

**Export**

The export section allows you to both export your Rive file, and export or remove all names for the exported file.

![Export Options Pn](/images/export_Options.png)

Read more about exporting a Rive file and its contents [here](https://rive.app/docs/editor/exporting/exporting-for-runtime).

**Generate Share Link**

<Note>Generating share links is available on Voyager and Enterprise plans. [Learn more about our plans and pricing](https://rive.app/pricing).</Note>

Share Links are a fast no-code way to get your Rive files running on a website or to present your graphics to a client.

![Sharelink Gi](/images/sharelink.gif)

Share the current version of the file you’re working with share links. Note that this is not the same as giving someone access to the live file with all its revision history. This link will be a frozen version of the file in its current state. If you make changes to the file, you’ll need to generate a new share link.

Learn more about share links [here](https://rive.app/docs/editor/share-links/overview).

**Publish to Marketplace**

The Marketplace is where you can share files with the entire Rive community.

![Publish Gi](/images/publish.gif)

Learn more about sharing your file to the Marketplace here.

**Cloud Renderer**

The file menu give you a way to both view and add new animation or presets to the render queue.

![Render Pn](/images/render.png)

Learn more about using our Cloud renderer [here](https://rive.app/docs/editor/exporting/exporting-for-video-and-static-design).

**Browse Sounds**

Rive allows you to add and play different sound effects in your file through Events. This option allows you to browse through our sound library.

![Sounds Pn](/images/sounds.png)

Read more about adding sound to your Rive file [here](https://rive.app/docs/editor/events/audio-events).

**Show Shortcuts**

The Show Shortcuts option allows you to view and search through all shortcuts in the Rive editor.

![Shortcuts Pn](/images/shortcuts.png)

**Documentation**

The Documentation option brings you directly to the Rive documentation.

**Send Feedback**

If you have thoughts on ways for us to improve Rive, the Send Feedback button will link you directly to our Requests page on our Community.


## Transform Tools menu

The Transform Tools menu houses tools that allow you to alter the transform properties of an object on the [Stage](/editor/interface-overview/stage).


![Select Pn](/images/select.png)

**Select Tool**

The Select tool allows you to select objects and manipulate all their transform properties with the gizmo that appears. You can also click and drag in an empty space to select multiple objects with a marquee.

In most cases, you'll probably be using the Select tool, though we also currently offer a dedicated Translate, Scale and Rotation tools.

![Image](/images/editor/interface-overview/5cfc252a-8d52-4751-9064-4c6a1acb6f34.webp)

The gizmo allows you to manipulate the position, rotation, and scale properties of a selection.

**Translate Tool**

The Translate tool allows you to click on the gizmo or in an empty space to modify the position of your selected object without losing selection.


**Rotate Tool**

The Rotate tool allows you to click on the gizmo or in an empty space to modify the rotation of your selected object without losing selection.


**Scale Tool**


The Scale tool allows you to click on the gizmo or in an empty space to modify the Scale of your selected object without losing selection.

**Freeze Mode**

Freeze mode allows you to modify the position of origins, groups, and bones without affecting the underlying objects associated with them.

Learn more about Origin and Freeze mode [here](https://rive.app/docs/editor/fundamentals/freeze-and-origin).

## View Options menu

The View options menu allows to control many different view options on the Rive Stage.

![Viewoptions Pn](/images/viewoptions.png)

**Zoom**

This option allows you both view and change the zoom level of the Rive editor.

**Snapping**

The Snapping option allows the Rive editor to help you contextually snap and align objects to one another. This can be disabled by either toggling the option off, or by holding CMD or CTRL while dragging an object.

**Snap to pixel**

Snap to pixel forces the Rive editor to snap an objects position to the nearest half pixel. When disabled, objects can be placed on any fraction of a pixle.

**User Cursors**

When multiple users are present in a file, we are able to visulize their mouse cursor. By disabling this option, we can hide other user cursors in our file.

**Gizmo**

The Gizmo is the visual object on the screen which lets us change the position, scale, or rotation of an object. By disabling this option, the Gizmo will no longer appear when selecting an object.

**Bones**

Disabling the Bones, the editor will hide any bones on the stage.

**Targets**

Disabling Targets will hide any Groups set to Target mode.

**Motion Paths**

When an objects X or Y property is selected on the Timeline a visulization of how the object will move over time appears as a motion path. We can disable this visulization by toggling off this option.

**Joysticks**

Disabling Joysticks will hide any Joysticks on the Stage.

**Events**

Disabling this option will hide any Events on the Stage.

**Layouts**

Layouts inherently have a skeleton visualization on the Stage to see the bounds of a layout container. Disabling this option will hide all visualizations of the layouts on the Stage.

**Layout Animations**

Layouts can automatically animate when various properties of a layout container change. Disabling this option will disable playback of all layout animations.

**Modifier Range**

This option visualizes a Text Modifiers Range when it is within view of the text object. Disabling this option hides the visualization.

**Modifier Range Values**

The Modifier Range Values visualize how the range is applied using little pips below each letter, word, or line. Disabling this option hides the visualization.

**Show Final Playback**

Show Final Playback automatically hides all elements and visualizations that would normally be hidden at runtime. For example, Bones and are not visible at runtime, so with this option enabled, the bones would automatically be hidden when a State Machine or Timeline plays. Disabling this option keeps things like bones visible during playback in the editor. Note that this has no effect at runtime.


## Export Button


The Export button allows you to create [Share Links](/editor/share-links/overview), [publish a file to the Marketplace](/community/marketplace-overview#marketplace-overview), [download a `.riv` file](/editor/exporting/exporting-for-runtime), and [publish a library](/editor/libraries).

title: "Hierarchy"
description: "The Hierarchy shows you all of the objects, assets, and view models in your file. This view changes based on the artboard, component, or tab you have selected."
---

import { YouTube } from '/snippets/youtube.mdx'

# Switching Views

To switch between the different panels, click on the desired panel.

![Switch View Gi](/images/SwitchView.gif)

# Hierarchy

The Hierarchy is a tree view, which shows both the parent-child relationships between objects on the stage as well as the order in which they are rendered. Learn about the Hierarchy by either watching the video or reading more below.

<YouTube id="FnnZV57Dp3c" />

Parent-child relationships are a core concept in Rive, which allows you to create complex layered animations with minimal effort. [Groups](/editor/fundamentals/groups) and [Bones](/editor/manipulating-shapes/bones) can have children in Rive.

Each row in the Hierarchy represents an item on the stage. A circle button with an arrow appears next to items that have children nested underneath them. This button allows you to expand and collapse the list of children.

## **Parent-child relationships**

<YouTube id="FnnZV57Dp3c" />

Any type of object can be a parent or a child of another type of object. When an object is a child of another object, it inherits all the transformations of its parent. For example, changing a parent objects scale will affect the child object. These transformations take place from the parents origin, not the local origin.

![Image](https://ucarecdn.com/7aed46e0-3a37-42c8-977f-f836f87a3304/)

The depth of these parent/child relationships is infinite, so you can keep stacking (or nesting) items to create grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and so on.


### **Change parent-child relationships**

To change the relationship between objects, drag and drop the object onto or out of another.

## **Draw Order**

In addition to displaying the relationships between objects, the Hierarchy shows you the Draw Order of a file, with the objects at the top being rendered in front and the objects at the bottom being rendered at the back.


### **Change Draw Order**


![Image](https://ucarecdn.com/5aeb4f67-a7f6-4efe-83bd-975880f79618/)

To change the Draw Order of objects on the stage, drag and drop the shape, or group of shapes above or below another in the list. Note that draw order also affects how objects are placed and treated in a layout. Read more about that [here](https://rive.app/docs/editor/layouts/layouts-overview).

The Draw Order can be animated, but the process is a bit more in-depth. Read about it on the [Animating Draw Order](https://rive.app/docs/editor/animate-mode/animating-draw-order) page.

## **Right Click Menu**

Right clicking any object in the hierarchy will bring up a menu with different options for each object. In the menu you'll find the ability to copy and paste both objects and styles, delete objects, wrap objects in [layouts](https://rive.app/docs/editor/layouts/layouts-overview) and [solos](https://rive.app/docs/editor/manipulating-shapes/solos), show the dependency graph, add a [tag](https://rive.app/docs/editor/tagging), reverse the draw order, and[ export a name](https://rive.app/docs/editor/exporting/exporting-for-runtime).

![Right Click Pn](/images/right_click.png)

Many of these options have shortcuts which can either be found next to the option, or in the shortcut menu.


# ​Assets Panel

The assets panel is a list view of your Images, Lottie files, Audio, and Custom fonts. This panel allows you to add, remove, replace, and modify all assets added in the file. Read more about importing and modifying assets below.

# Data Panel

The Data Panel is where all View Models, Enums, and Coverters for a file are created, organized, and viewed.  The panel is broken into three seperate spaces; View Models, Enums, and Converters. Read more about Data Binding [here](https://rive.app/docs/editor/data-binding/overview).

![Data Pn](/images/Data.png)

The plus button on the right of each section allows you to add a new View Model, Enum, or Converter.

If any section has elements associated with it, the list can be expanded or collapsed using the arrow icon on the left.

---

# Inspector

An object's editable properties can be found in the Inspector. The Inspector changes dynamically depending on your selected object and where you are in the editor.

![Inspector Pn](/images/inspector.png)

## Background Color, Tags, Default Interpolation

When nothing is selected, the Inspector has three sections: Backgrounds, Tags, and Default Interpolation.

**Background color**

Found at the top of the Inspector, this section allows you to change the background color of the editor for both Animate and Design modes. This is a helpful way to remind yourself which mode you are currently in.

![Backgrounds Pn](/images/backgrounds.png)

**Tags**

Below the background color, you can see, edit, and add new tags to your file. Learn more about tags [here](https://rive.app/docs/editor/tagging).

![Tags Pn](/images/tags.png)

**Default Interpolation**

Below Tags is the Default Interpolation for your file.

![Default Int Pn](/images/default_Int.png)

When you set a key on the timeline, it will use the file's default interpolation until it's changed on the timeline. By changing the default interpolation, you can control which interpolation curve is applied to new keys.

## Align and Distribute tools

When one or more objects, such as shapes or groups, are selected, the Align tools appear at the top of the inspector. Use them to align or distribute the selected objects. Read more about the Align tools here.

![Align Pn](/images/Align.png)

## Layout and N-Slicing

When one or more objects, such as shapes or groups, are selected, the inspector gives the option to layout or n-slice the current selection.

## Transform properties

The transform properties of an object appear below the Align tools. Generally, these properties include position, scale, and rotation, but they can also include width and height if you have a path layer selected.

![Transform Pn](/images/Transform.png)

## Layer properties

Below the transform properties, you'll find several properties that allow you to customize the look of some objects on the stage. These properties include blend mode, opacity, fill, and stroke.

## Selection

Select an object by simply clicking on it, or click and drag over a number of shapes to perform a marquee selection. Hold the `Shift` modifier key to add or remove from an existing selection (by either single clicking or marqueeing).

### Double-click

To select an object in a group, double-click on the object you want to select. This takes you down one level in the hierarchy and allows you to select any object on that level.

### Deep select

In order to select an object within a group, hold `⌘` (macOS) or `Ctrl` (Windows) and click directly on it. This is a quick way to cut through multiple layers of nested groups and directly select a shape. This can be a very fast way to navigate a complex file, especially when used together with the Select behind technique and the Enter and Esc shortcuts described below.

### Select behind

When you hover over an object on the stage, Rive draws an outline around it. This is a hint to let you know that if you click, this object will be selected. Sometimes multiple objects can overlap one another, making it difficult to select the exact one you want. In this case, press `Alt` to cycle to the next object under your cursor. You can continue to press `Alt` until the object you want is outlined. Now click to select it.

### Enter and Esc shortcuts

Use the `Enter` key to quickly navigate down the Hierarchy. If you have a group selected, this allows you to quickly select the first child.

Use the `Esc` key to quickly navigate up the Hierarchy. This allows you to quickly select the parent of your current selection.

### Panning

![Image](https://ucarecdn.com/e1605c44-d098-4a7e-940d-a4278ef53be8/)

To pan the Stage, right-click and drag your mouse. If you have a trackpad, scroll left and right. Alternatively, hold `Spacebar` to trigger the Pan Tool. With the Pan Tool enabled, click and drag to move to your desired point on the Stage.

### Zooming

![Image](https://ucarecdn.com/c9384609-023a-42a0-bab3-5ff6043598b2/)

With your cursor positioned over the Stage, hold `⌘` / `Ctrl` and scroll your mouse or trackpad to zoom in and out. Alternatively, use the `+` / `-` keys to zoom between preset points. You can quickly revert back to 100% with `⌘` / `Ctrl` and `0`.

### Fit

![Image](https://ucarecdn.com/7b03a9e1-2577-46a8-9cc8-7c6661f91a8e/)

Tap `F` to simultaneously zoom and position your active artboard to fit within the viewable Stage area. Note that if you have an object within the Hierarchy selected this action will be performed on the object as opposed to the artboard.

> There are a few scenarios where you may have "lost" an artboard, while still seeing the hierarchy. This typically happens when the position of an artboard is accidentially keyed or the zoom level is too far out. Using the `F`shortcut will help you fix the issue by Filling the stage with the selected object or artboard.

title: "Design vs Animate Mode"
description: "The Rive Editor has two distinct modes, Design and Animate. Switching between modes changes the interface to show the appropriate tools and options."
---

## Design Mode

Use Design Mode to prepare your graphics for animation. This is where you can design your own graphics with Rive's [tools](../interface-overview/toolbar), [import graphics from other software](./importing-assets), or rig your graphics with [bones](../manipulating-shapes/bones), [transform spaces](./transform-spaces), [layouts](https://rive.app/docs/editor/layouts/layouts-overview), [joysticks](https://rive.app/docs/editor/manipulating-shapes/joysticks), and [constraints](../constraints/).

![Image](/images/editor/fundamentals/Design_Mode.png)

Design Mode is the default mode for any file that doesn't have any animations created. The mode exists because Rive allows you to attach multiple animations to a single artboard, so you need a place to set up and create those graphics.

## Animate Mode

Use [Animate Mode](../animate-mode/) to create all of the [States](https://rive.app/docs/editor/state-machine/states) and [State Machine](../state-machine/) for your artboard.

When you switch to Animate Mode, the UI updates to display a list of Timelines and State Machine associated with the [active artboard](./artboards#active-artboard). The [Inspector](https://rive.app/docs/editor/interface-overview/inspector) also updates to show key buttons next to any property that can be animated.

![Animate Mode Pn](/images/editor/fundamentals/Animate_Mode.png)

Selecting any Animation from the Animations list will bring up a timeline view, while selecting a state machine will replace the timeline with the graph view.

![State Machine Pn](/images/editor/fundamentals/State_Machine.png)

## Creating Assets in Animate Mode

While there are separate modes, graphics can be created and changed in both modes, but it's important to keep a few things in mind.

1. If a Timeline is selected, graphics, both procedural and custom paths, can be created. While graphics can be created, any changes to the path, shape, or its properties will automatically be keyed on the timeline. Because of this, we recommend not making any assets when a timeline is selected.
2. Animate Mode works like Design Mode if a State Machine is selected. Asset creation, rigging, and other design changes will not be automatically keyed. This lets you make any design changes you want without switching between the different modes, though you do lose some screen real estate due to the graph. We recommend making vast changes in Design mode while using Animate mode only to add quick adjustments like hitboxes or layouts.

title: "Artboards"
description: "Artboards are the foundation of a file."

import { YouTube } from '/snippets/youtube.mdx'


Artboards are the foundation of your composition across both design and animate mode. They act as the root of every hierarchy and let you define a scene's dimensions and background color. You can create infinite artboards on the [Stage](../interface-overview/stage), but each Rive file has at least one artboard.

![Artboard Pn](/images/artboard.png)


 

## ​Active artboard


The active artboard is represented with an Active tag next to its name on the stage. You can activate an artboard by clicking on it or any of its children within the stage. Note that sections of the editor will only surface content associated with the active artboard. For instance, only the active artboard's hierarchy is displayed in the tree. Similarly, only animations referenced to the active artboard will surface within the timeline.


<img
  src="/images/active.gif"
  alt="Active Gi"
  title="Active Gi"
  style={{ width:"100%" }}
/>

The active artboard is represented with a dot next to its name on the stage. You can activate an artboard by clicking on it or any of its children within the stage. Note that sections of the editor will only surface content associated with the active artboard. For instance, only the active artboard's hierarchy is displayed in the tree. Similarly, only animations referenced to the active artboard will surface within the timeline.

## Default State Machine

The default state machine is the state machine that will be played when using the play button in the Toolbar. In addition to setting the default state machine, this also sets the default artboard that a developer will see when using this file outside of Rive.

![Default SM Gi](/images/defaultSM.gif)

To change the default state machine, use the dropdown to select the one you want to use.

You can quickly play the selected state machine from Design Mode by holding shift and hitting the space bar.

![Play Default Gi](/images/playDefault.gif)

## ​Creating an artboard

Before creating any graphics, you'll first need to create an artboard. There are two ways to create an artboard.

In a new file, you'll find options on the stage to define an artboards dimentions or to select from a few defined presets. Once you've decided on the properties, you can then hit the Create Artboard button.

![Create AB Gi](/images/create_AB.gif)


Alternitively, you can use the​ Artboard tool which is found in the Artboard menu, or by using the shotcut A. With the tool active, click and drag to define the bounds. You can always adjust the size and position by selecting the artboard in the [Hierarchy](../interface-overview/hierarchy) to surface its properties in the [Inspector](../interface-overview/inspector).

## Artboard properties

Every artboard has various properties that can be changed in the [Inspector](../interface-overview/inspector). Some of the attributes that can be changed include an artboard's position on the [Stage](../interface-overview/stage), its size, layout properties, fill color, origin point, and render presets.

![Artboard Prop Pn](/images/artboard_prop.png)

## **Position**

The position of the artboard on the stage is controlled by the position properties of the artboard.

## Size and Size Type

By default, artboards are set to a fixed size with that size being determined by the Width and Height properties.

![Wand H Pn](/images/WandH.png)

**Link Icon**

Like other properties where the link icon is found, it can be used to lock the current ratio of the size properties.

![Link Pn](/images/link.png)

**Size Type**

There are two sizing modes an artboard can have; Fixed, and Hug. These can be changed by using the dropdown under both the Width and Height properties.

![Size Type Pn](/images/size_type.png)

As the name suggests, the Fixed type allows you to define and animate the artboards size properties.

The Hug type will let the artboard automatically size its height, width, or both to fit it's children. Note that this option is only available if the artboard has at least one child layout object.

## Origin

The origin of an artboard determines the point from which all objects associated with the artboard will be measured. By default, the origin of an artboard is X:0%, Y:0%. These values place the origin at the top left of the artboard.

![Origin Pn](/images/origin.png)

As you increase the value of either the X or Y, that shifts the origin point to the right (on the X), and down (on the Y).

You won't typically be changing the origin of an artboard, but if you plan on changing the origin, it's best done before any animation work is done. Changing the origin after animation keys are added can cause objects to appear out of position due to the origin shifting to a new position.

**Component Origin**

It's important to remember that a Component shares the origin of its source artboard. If you plan to do things like scale or rotate the Component, changing the origin will help make that process easier.

If you forget to change the origin after adding animations, you can always add the Component to a group, which will give you the same level of control.

## Layout Settings

Since an Artboard is the root object that all other objects are added to, Artboards allow you to add and adjust their layout properties. Read more about layouts [here](https://rive.app/docs/editor/layouts/layouts-overview).

![Layout Pn](/images/layout.png)

Note that these properties only take effect when one or more layouts have been added to the artboard.

## Fill and Stroke

Like other objects in Rive, Artboards can have one or more fills or strokes added to them. The process of adding and customizing fills and strokes is the same for both artboards and objects in the hierarchy.

![Fillandstroke Pn](/images/fillandstroke.png)

Read more about fills and strokes [here](https://rive.app/docs/editor/fundamentals/fill-and-stroke).

## Render Presets

Selecting an artboard allows you to create Render Presets that can be used to render out static graphics such as PNGs and SVGs, as well as video and motion files like PNG sequences and MP4s.

![Render Pn](/images/render.png)

Read more about creating render presets [here](https://rive.app/docs/editor/exporting/exporting-for-video-and-static-design).

## Selected Colors

When an artboard is selected, you can see, target, and adjust all colors associated with every object on the artboard.

title: "Components (formerly Nested Artboards)"
sidebarTitle: "Components"
description: "Components streamline your workflow with reusable artboards and animations. Changes made to the source component are reflected across all of its instances."
---

## Creating a Component

Any artboard can be converted to a component. To do so, select an artboard on the stage and use the component icon in the inspector to toggle its status.

Alternatively, you can use the `Shift` + `N` shortcut with an artboard selected. If you're coming from Figma, then the `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Alt/Option` + `K`, shortcut will also work.

Select the component toggle in the inspector again to revert your selection back to a regular artboard, or use the `Shift` + `Alt/Option` + `N` shortcut.

Currently, only artboards that have been flagged as components will be exported to your `.riv` file. If you think you may want to programmatically access an artboard at runtime, you should mark it as a component. More options on specific export behaviors are coming soon.

## Using Components

Use the Component Tool — formerly known as the Nested Artboard Tool — to select and place instances of a component on the stage. Select the tool from the toolbar or use the `N` shortcut to enable it.

Click anywhere on the stage to place the component in the desired location. A menu will display available components to instance. If none show up, you may have no artboards marked as components in your file.

![Image](/images/editor/fundamentals/components-add.gif)

Alternatively, select the dropdown menu to the right of the toolbar icon to select the component ahead of time. The menu is informed by the sort mode of the assets tab — the 'Custom' mode will present components as they’re organised in the asset panel, while the 'Source/Type' mode will present components from their source. The latter will become useful with our Libraries feature.

## Configuring a Component Instance

Once you’ve added an instance of a component, select a timeline or state machine for playback.

### State Machines

After assigning an instance, the default state machine is displayed in the inspector.

![Image](/images/editor/fundamentals/components-statemachine.gif)

If you’ve exposed any inputs, you can access them using the options menu (when an animation is selected) or via the inputs panel when a state machine is selected.

![Image](/images/editor/fundamentals/components-nested_inputs.gif)

### Adding an Animation

You can playback any animation associated with a component. You’ll need to add the desired animation to the instance using the plus button in the Inspector.

![Image](/images/editor/fundamentals/components-animations.gif)

These animations can be used by themselves, mixed with the state machine, or layered with other animations.

Note that before adding the animation, you must select whether it's a simple or remapped animation.

#### Simple

Simple animations are an easy way to playback a component's timeline.

![Image](/images/editor/fundamentals/components-animation-simple.gif)

A simple animation lets you key its start point on a timeline. You also have the option to change the animation's playback speed.

#### Remap

Remap animations allow you to key time values of an animation on the timeline. This lets you stretch, shrink, or even play an animation in reverse.

![Image](/images/editor/fundamentals/components-animation-remap.gif)

Note that the time value is in percent, with 0% representing the start of the timeline and 100% representing the end.

### Mix Value

As you add additional animations to a Component, animations begin to mix together. This mixing is important, especially when multiple animations share keyed properties. Without adjusting this value, your Component may not playback your animations in the way you want.

By default, any animation added to a component starts with a mix value of 100%. You can adjust this value in design mode or in a specific animation by setting keys. **Note that an animation that has a non-zero mix value will always be mixing with other animations, regardless if it has a play key set or not.**

To ensure the correct animation is playing, ensure that you key the mix value for the desired animation to 100%, and all other animations have a mix of 0%.

## Instance Modes

Component instances can be set to use one of 3 modes which will behave differently based on their contents and the context in which they are used. The Leaf and Layout modes are typically used when the parent artboard needs to layout its contents responsively.

### Node

This is the default mode and is used in non-responsive scenarios. Its contents will always appear scaled (via the Scale property).

### Leaf

![Image](/images/editor/fundamentals/components-leaf.png)

Leaf mode will result in the Component always being positioned and resized relative to its containing Layout or Artboard. This can be useful if the Component contains elements that need to resize to its container, but don't contain Layouts themselves.

#### Leaf Fit

The Fit type determines how the Component Leaf will scale within it's allotted area.

- **Fill (Default)**: Content will fill the available view. If the aspect ratios differ, then the Rive content will be stretched.
- **Contain**: Content will be contained within the view, preserving the aspect ratio. If the ratios differ, then a portion of the view will be unused.
- **Cover**: Rive will cover the view, preserving the aspect ratio. If the content has a different ratio to the view, then the content will be clipped.
- **Fit Width**: Content will fill to the width of the view. This may result in clipping or unfilled view space.
- **Fit Height**: Content will fill to the height of the view. This may result in clipping or unfilled view space.
- **None**: Content will render to the original size of its artboard, which may result in clipping or unfilled view space.
- **Scale Down**: Content is scaled down to the size of the view, preserving the aspect ratio. This is equivalent to **Contain** when the content is larger than the canvas. If the canvas is larger, then **ScaleDown** will not scale up.

#### Leaf Alignment

The Alignment type determines how the contents are aligned within the allotted area. Alignment is set in a 3x3 grid fashion: **Center (Default)**, **Bottom Left**, **Bottom Center**, **Bottom Right**, **Left Center**, **Right Center**, **Top Left**, **Top Center**, **Top Right**.

#### Leaf Alignment Position X/Y

Leaf Alignment Position is a numerical representation of Alignment and can be used in cases where the 9 Alignment options are not desirable. Values can be represented in the following ways: X = -1 (Left), 0 (Center), 1 (Right) and Y = -1 (Top), 0 (Center), 1 (Bottom). Non-integer values can also be used in order to align in various ways, for example, X = 0.5 will position the content half way between Center and Right.

### Layout

![Image](/images/editor/fundamentals/components-layout.png)

Layout mode is used when your Component contains Layouts that need to remain responsive as the size of its parent changes. This is the only mode where the Component contents are not scaled, rather the artboard size changes in order to reflow the Components's contents.

#### Layout Scale Type

- **Fixed** - A fixed width or height for the layout. The defined value can be either a point or percentage value. Use the unit toggle within the fields to toggle between value types.
- **Hug** - The width and/or height of the layout shrinks to fit its children. This is useful if your Component contains text or other objects that need to determine it's size.
- **Fill** - The width and/or height of the layout expands to fill the available space within the parent layout or artboard.

#### Layout Size

When set to Fixed, the width and height of the Component can be set to either pixel or percent values. This is different than the scale property, which changes the Components's scale. Typically scale should not be used when Layout mode is selected.

## Exposing Inputs and Events

Expose the Inputs and/or Events of a Componet to control them from a parent/host Artboard. This allows you to control one Component with another via a State Machine.

### How to Expose an Input

Exposing an Input allows the parent artboard to access and manipulate it. To do this, select the desired input, then check the expose to main artboard option in the inspector.

![Image](https://ucarecdn.com/251b0247-ae05-4f58-8858-8e7a21abd816/)

After creating a Component, you’ll see any exposed inputs in the Inspector via the options panel and in the Inputs panel.

### Using Inputs on a Parent Artboard

Exposed inputs can be found in the Inputs panel or in the inspector. You can use them through listeners, an event, or by keying them on a timeline.

![Image](https://ucarecdn.com/ee1dd959-9fba-45c9-a74b-1173cd71e894/)

#### Via a Listener

When you create a listener, you’ll find all exposed Inputs as a set input property of a Listener. This option lets you, for example, change the boolean input of multiple artboards simultaneously.

![Image](https://ucarecdn.com/2349fdd6-5a5a-434e-a1dc-3974e6f1e01c/)

#### Using Events

Additionally, we can use Listeners to listen for Events firing from our Component, and change inputs accordingly.

![Image](https://ucarecdn.com/2b1ddae6-31c9-41be-969c-86a59b2206cd/)

To see an Event associated with an Artboard, you’ll need to set the Artboard as a target of the Listener. The Event will now be listed as a listener action.

#### Keying on the State Machine

You can key exposed inputs on the parent artboard via the options panel in the inspector.

This is a handy trick when you, for example, want to set the text value within an Instance.

title: "Shapes and Paths Overview"
description: "Rive allows you to create, edit, and animate vector graphics using either procedural or custom shapes. These graphics combine shape and path layers to define them, which Rive exposes to give you greater flexibility and control with your designs and animations."
---

import { YouTube } from '/snippets/youtube.mdx'

To learn more about Shape and Path layers, watch our video on Shapes and Paths, or read more below.

<YouTube id="KunkCnbkTsg" />

## Shape layer

![Shape Layer](/images/editor/fundamentals/shape-and-path-shapelayer.png)

Vectors in Rive are rendered on shape layers. Shape layers define the style of the shape by allowing you to customize the fill and stroke.\`

![Fill and Stroke](/images/editor/fundamentals/shape-and-path-fill.png)

## Path layer

![Path Layer](/images/editor/fundamentals/shape-and-path-pathlayer.gif)

The actual shape of a vector is defined by a path (or multiple paths). Expanding a shape layer in Rive will reveal the paths it's using.

![Move Path](/images/editor/fundamentals/shape-and-path-move.gif)

‌You can add new paths to any shape by dragging and dropping an existing path onto the desired shape layer.

### Path layer properties

Path layers display properties that to the type of path. Learn more about [Procedural Shapes](/editor/fundamentals/procedural-shapes).

![Path layer Properties](/images/editor/fundamentals/shape-and-path-properties.png)

## Enter and Esc shortcuts

Use the `Enter` key to quickly navigate down the Hierarchy. If you have a shape selected, this allows you to select the child path layer quickly.

Use the `Esc` key to quickly navigate up the Hierarchy. If you have a path selected, this allows you to select the parent shape layer quickly.

---
title: "Procedural Shapes"
---

import { YouTube } from '/snippets/youtube.mdx'

<YouTube id="vU5SrgymGD8" />

## Creating a procedural shape

![Procedural Shapes Menu](/images/editor/fundamentals/procedural-shapes-menu.png)

Under the Create Tools menu, you will find shape tools that are defined by procedural properties like width, height, corner radius, number of points, and more.

![Create Shape](/images/editor/fundamentals/procedural-shapes-create.gif)

Select the tool then click and drag anywhere inside an artboard. Hold `shift` to constrain the proportions of the shape.

### Convert a procedural path to a custom path

![Convert a procedural path to a custom path](/images/editor/fundamentals/procedural-shapes-convert.gif)

To edit the vertices of a procedural path, press `Enter` on your keyboard. This will covert the path into a custom path and allow you to modify the position of each vertex. Procedural properties (e.g. width, height, number of points) will no longer be available. Keep in mind that any animations applied to these properties will also be removed once the procedural path is converted to a custom path.

### Origin of a procedural path

The [origin](/editor/fundamentals/freeze-and-origin) of a procedural path determines where its properties originate from. For example, changing the width on a rectangle with its origin in the middle (50% X and 50% Y) causes it to grow from its center.

![Change size of procedura shape](/images/editor/fundamentals/procedural-shapes-size.gif)

Changing the width of a rectangle with its origin on the left side (0% X) causes it to grow from its left.

![Origin in procedural shapes](/images/editor/fundamentals/procedural-shapes-origin.gif)

This is particularly useful when animating paths that have other procedural properties enabled, such as rounded corners.

title: "Groups"
description: "Use groups to organize your graphics or to add extra transform spaces."
---

import { YouTube } from '/snippets/youtube.mdx'

<YouTube id="FnnZV57Dp3c" />

Activate the Group tool with the `G` shortcut. Click anywhere in an artboard to add a new group. Now drag and drop objects into the group in the Hierarchy.

You can also wrap a selection of shapes into a group with `⌘`\+`G` in macOS or `Ctrl`\+`G` in Windows.

Unwrap a group with `⌘`\+`Shift`\+`G` in macOS or `Ctrl`\+`Shift` +`G` in Windows.

## Group Style

The Style property of a group can be set to Group or Target.

### Group

Group is the default behavior, which behaves as described in the [Selecting and Navigating Groups](/editor/fundamentals/selecting-and-navigating-groups).

### Target

The Target option draws a different icon on the Stage that is always visible, regardless of whether the group has children (usually a group only displays an icon if it is empty). When a group displays as a Target, it also disables the functionality described in [Selecting and Navigating Groups](/editor/fundamentals/selecting-and-navigating-groups) section. This means you can immediately click through to any child of the group (no need to double-click, enter/esc, or Deep Select).

![Groups change Target](/images/editor/fundamentals/groups-targets.gif)

The Target option is particularly useful when working with Constraints.

title: "Transform Spaces"
---

import { YouTube } from '/snippets/youtube.mdx'

Container Objects, like Groups, Bones, and Layouts, allow you to create new transform spaces for your graphics, opening up the ability to animate graphics from multiple areas of interest. For example, you might want a planet to rotate on its own axis while also rotating around another planet. Multiple transform spaces (achieved by nesting groups, bones, and other container objects) allow you to achieve this.

This technique is a fundamental concept for all motion graphics. To learn more about transform spaces, be sure to watch our video on hierarchical relationships.

<YouTube id="IcSXchdnzHM" />

## Transform space example

![Image](https://ucarecdn.com/8d60bc32-96ce-4b77-ade8-836f7c92b51d/)

Nest multiple groups to transform your shapes from different locations. In the example above, a group is rotating the Earth, another is rotating the Moon around the Earth, and another is rotating the moon on its axis.

# Fill

### **Create a new Fill**

To create a fill, select a shape, then use the plus button under the Fill and Stroke section of the Inspector. Be sure to select Fill from the new menu. You'll be able to tell that a layer is a fill by looking at the color box on the left side.

![New Fill Gi](/images/newFill.gif)

### **Changing Fill color**

To change the color of a Fill, select the color box on the left side of the Fill layer. This will open the Color Picker. From there, you can use the various sliders to choose which color you'd like for the Fill.

![Changecolor Gi](/images/changecolor.gif)

### **Changing Fill Type**

When a new shape is created, by defualt the shape will have a solid fill. When a new fill is added, by default the fill type is set to linear. We often need to change the fill type between the different types. This can be done by selecting the color box.

![Changefilltype Gi](/images/changefilltype.gif)

Once the Fill has been opened, you'll find the Fill Selector dropdown in the top of the option box.

The different fills that can be selected are:

- **Solid**
- **Linear Gradient**
- **Radial Gradient**

### **Changing Fill color (Gradient)**

To change the color of a Fill, select the color box on the left side of the Fill layer. This will open the Color Picker.

![Changestopper Gi](/images/changestopper.gif)

When a gradient is selected, you'll notice a new bar appear above the color picker. This repersents the color of the gradient at different points.

By default, a gradient has two points.

### **Changing the color of a stopper**

To change the color of a particular color stopper, start by selecting the stopper you'd like to change.

Next, use the various sliders to choose which color that stopper should be.

### **Adding and removing stoppers**

To add a new color stopper, click any space along the long that isn't currently occupied by another stopper. This will generate an additional color stopper.

![Add Remove Gi](/images/add_remove.gif)

To delete a color stopper, select the stopper you'd like to delete, then hit the Delete or Backspace key.

### **Change Fill Order**

The order in which fills are organized in the fill determine their render order with fills on top being rendered in the front and fills at the bottom being rendered at the back.

![Fill Order Gi](/images/fillOrder.gif)

This order can be changed at any time my clicking and dragging on an empty area within the layer.

### **Fill Properties**

Each Fill has its own properties which can be edited and keyed on the timeline. Some of these properties can be found by using the fill option button.

![Fill Prop Pn](/images/fillProp.png)

**Fill Name -** You can edit the name of a fill using this property.

**Blend -** This option can be used to change the Blend Mode of an individual Fill. By default, this mode will be set to inherit, which inherits the blend mode from the shape layer.

**Fill Rule -**  This option can be used to change the fill rule for the Fill. This must be set to clock-wise if you want the fill to be feathered.

\*\*Feather - \*\*This option can be toggled to feather the chosen Fill. Read more about Feathering below.

### **Deleting and hiding a Fill**

Often times we'll need to delete or hide a particular Fill. This can be done by selecting the shape, then using the eye icon to hide the Fill, or the minus icon to delete the fill.

![Delete Gi](/images/delete.gif)

### Fill Rule

<YouTube id="3GUh1Rl6hgY" />

The Fill Rule determines how overlapping paths in a shape will be filled:

- **Non-Zero** assigns a \+1 value to clockwise paths and a -1 value to counter clock wise paths. Areas that equal a value other than 0 will be filled.
- **Even-Odd** assignes a \+1 value to clockwise paths and a -1 value to counter clock wise paths. Areas that equal an even value will be filled while odd values wont be.
- **Clockwise** a Fill Rule exlusive to Rive. This fill rule enables manual subtraction of paths which can be found in edit vertices mode. This fill rule is also required for shapes where you'd like to enable vector feathering.

# Stroke

### Create a new Stroke

To create a Stroke, select a shape, then use the plus button under the Fill and Stroke section of the Inspector. Be sure to select Stroke from the new menu. You'll be able to tell that a layer is a Stroke by looking at the color box on the left side. Strokes are represented by an outlined box.

![New Stroke Gi](/images/NewStroke.gif)

### **Changing stroke color (solid)**

To change the color of a Stroke, select the color box on the left side of the Stroke layer. This will open the Color Picker. From there, you can use the various sliders to choose which color you'd like for the Stroke.

![Stroke Color Gi](/images/StrokeColor.gif)

### **Changing Stroke type**

By default, strokes are set to a solid color, but various stroke types are avaiable from the Color Picker menu.

![Change Stroke Type Gi](/images/ChangeStrokeType.gif)

The different strokes that can be selected are:

- **Solid**
- **Linear Gradient**
- **Radial Gradient**

### **Changing Stroke color (Gradient)**

To change the color of a Stroke, select the color box on the left side of the Stroke layer. This will open the Color Picker.

When a gradient is selected, you'll notice a new bar appear above the color picker. This repersents the color of the gradient at different points.

By default, a gradient has two points.

### **Changing the color of a stopper**

To change the color of a particular color stopper, start by selecting the stopper you'd like to change.

![Change Gradient Color Gi](/images/ChangeGradientColor.gif)

Next, use the various sliders to choose which color that stopper should be.

### **Adding and removing stoppers**

To add a new color stopper, click any space along the long that isn't currently occupied by another stopper. This will generate an additional color stopper.

![Add Remove Stroke Stopper Gi](/images/add_removeStroke_Stopper.gif)

To delete a color stopper, select the stopper you'd like to delete, then hit the Delete or Backspace key.

### **Deleting and hiding a Stroke**

Often times we'll need to delete or hide a particular Stroke. This can be done by selecting the shape, then using the eye icon to hide the Stroke, or the minus icon to delete the Stroke.

# Stroke Properties

Each Stroke has its own properties which can be edited and keyed on the timeline. Some of these properties can be found by using the Stroke option button.

**Stroke Name -** You can edit the name of a Stroke using this property.

**Blend -** This option can be used to change the Blend Mode of an individual Stroke. By default, this mode will be set to inherit, which inherits the blend mode from the shape layer.

**Cap -** This option changes the end cap of a Stroke. Read more about the different Caps below.

- **Butt** The end of the stroke is a straight line and does not extend beyond the end vertices. On a zero-length path, the stroke will not be rendered at all.
- **Round** The ends of a stroke are rounded. On a zero-length path, the stroke is a full circle.
- **Square** The ends of a stroke are squared off and extend beyond the end vertices. On a zero-length path, the stroke is a square.

**Join -** This option changes how the corners of a Stroke are rendered. Read more about the different Join options below.

- **Round** creates a rounded corner.
- **Bevel** creates a beveled corner.
- **Miter** creates a mitered corner.

**Apply Transformations -** The Apply Transformations toggle determines whether the shape layers scale will affect the thickness of the stroke. When this is toggled off, the thickness of the stroke will stay the same regardless of scale.

**Feather -** This option can be toggled to feather the chosen stroke. Read more about Feathering below.

**Stroke Type** - At the bottom of the Stroke Options Panel, you'll find options to change your stroke between a solid, trim, dashed stroke.

- **Solid -** Renders the stroke as a solid stroke. This is the default stroke type for each new stroke created.
- **Trim -**  Lets you animate the start, end, and offset of a line segment. Read more [here](https://rive.app/docs/editor/manipulating-shapes/trim-path).
- **Dashed -** Lets you create dashed strokes with animateable property like the length of the dashed segment and offest.  Read more [here.](https://rive.app/docs/editor/manipulating-shapes/trim-path)

# Vector Feathering

Vector feathering is a new way to feather both Fills and Strokes. Vector Feathering is a technique we invented at Rive that can soften the edge of vector paths without the typical performance impact of traditional blur effects.

### **Enabling Vector Feathering**

There are two main ways to enable vector feathering on any Stroke of Fill.

![Enable Feather Gi](/images/EnableFeather.gif)

- **Feather Icon -** The feathering icon can be used on any Fill or Stroke layer to enable vector feathering.
- **Feather Toggle -** The feather toggle can be found in the Fill / Stroke options panel.

### Feathering Options

Feathers can be customized in a number of ways. The Feathering options can be found in the options panel once Feathering has been enabled on a Fill or Stroke.

**Direction** - This option lets you choose which direction the path will feather as you increase the feather amount.

![Direction Gi](/images/Direction.gif)

- Outter - This option creates a feather that will feather outward from the path.
- Inner - This option creates a feather that will feather inward from the path.

**Amount** - This option lets you increase or decrease the amount of feather applied.

![Amount Gi](/images/amount.gif)

**Space -** Determines how the feathered fill or stroke will apply transforms from the parent if any offset is present on the feather.

![Space Gi](/images/space.gif)

- World - Transforms will be applied from the world transform. Feather will now act as a drop shadow.
- Local - Transforms will be applied from the local transform. This mode will have the feather work with transforms as you'd expect.

**Offset** - The Offset properties let you move the feather away from the path by increasing or decreasing the X and Y numbers.

![Amount Gi](/images/amount.gif)

title: "Edit Vertices"
description: "No matter the type of vector you create, you can edit the vertices by changing their position or handles in both design and animate mode."
---

## Edit Vertices mode

To enter Edit Vertices mode, either select the shape and hit enter twice or select a path and hit enter once.


![EVM Gi](/images/EVM.gif)


After activating Edit Vertices mode, you can select any vertex, reposition it, and edit the bezier handles.

### Deep Selection

You may want to select and edit a specific path when dealing with a group of shapes. You can either find that path in the Hierarchy or you can use Deep Selection to select it directly on the Stage.

To select a path within a group on the stage, hold `⌘` (Mac) or `ctrl` (Windows) and click the target path. Alternatively, you can double-click on the path you want to select.

### Path Options

Each path in Edit Vertices mode has a set of path options at the top of the Inspector.


**Done Editing Button**


The Done Editing button can be used to exit Edit Vertices Mode.

![Done Edit Pn](/images/DoneEdit.png)

**Open Path**

The Open Path button will disconnect the last vertex from the first vertex.

![Open Path Pn](/images/OpenPath.png)

**Reverse Direction**

The Reverse Direction button can be used to reverse the direction of the path. Depending on the Fill-Rule, this can eliminate holes in our shape by changing the mathmatical value of the selected path.

**Convert Radial Corners**

Straight vertices with a corner radius will deform when the scale transform is applied to the shape or path layer. You can convert radial corners from a procedural property to a defined set of vertices. This process will eliminate deformation of the corner.


![Convert Gi](/images/convert.gif)


## Bezier Handles


**‌Straight**

‌The default handles are set to straight, which creates straight edges between vertices.

![Straight Pn](/images/Straight.png)

**Corner Radius**

The Corner Radius property allows you to round straight corners. This property only appears on vertices that are set to straight.

**‌Mirrored**


‌Mirrored is the default handle when you create a vertex by clicking and dragging. These handles always keep the same rotation and length.

![Mirriored Gi](/images/mirriored.gif)


**‌Detached‌**

Detached handles allow each handle to have its own rotation and length.

![Detached Gi](/images/detached.gif)

**‌Asymmetric**


‌Asymmetric handles share the same rotation but can have lengths independently of each other.


![Asem Gi](/images/asem.gif)

title: "Freeze and Origin"
---

import { YouTube } from '/snippets/youtube.mdx'

<YouTube id="nA15ZXkMb_c" />

When you transform objects, their children inherit the same transformations. The location where these transformations happen (sometimes called the origin, anchor point, or pivot) affects how your objects animate.

For example, manipulating the scale of a group creates different results if the scale originates in the center or the bottom.

You need to reposition the parent group to change the point of origin for these transformations. However, moving a parent causes all the children to move with it. The Freeze feature makes it possible to achieve this without having to rework the hierarchy structure.

# Origin of a Procedural Path

Procedural objects (like artboards and procedural paths) have an origin property. The origin of a procedural path determines where its properties originate from. For example, changing the width of a rectangle with its origin in the middle (50% X and 50% Y) causes it to grow from its center.

![Origin in the center](/images/editor/fundamentals/freeze-origin-center.gif)

Changing the width on a rectangle with its origin on the left side (0% X) causes it to grow from its left.

![Origin on the left](/images/editor/fundamentals/freeze-origin-left.gif)

This is particularly useful when animating paths that have other procedural properties enabled, such as rounded corners.

You can use the Freeze feature to change the Origin position on the Stage. Alternatively, set the exact value in the Inspector.

# Origin of a Custom Path and Group

### Freeze Mode

The Freeze feature allows you to move any parent object (groups, shapes, bones) without affecting the position of its children. Activate Freeze in the [Transform Tools menu](../interface-overview/toolbar) or use the `Y` shortcut.

When Freeze Mode is active, you'll notice that your Stage is wrapped in a blue outline. You're now free to move the Origin without affecting the children.

Be sure to turn off Freeze by pressing `Y` again.

# Changin Origin with Align Tools

You can quickly change the location of an origin with the align tools.

Start by selecting the shape, then holding Option on Mac, or Alt on Windows. \
\
This now allows the align tool to repostion the Origin various positions.

import { YouTube } from '/snippets/youtube.mdx'

<YouTube id="vH9UHmdVwx4" />

<YouTube id="hPbgPGJNE78" />

## Assets Panel

After dragging in your graphics, they now appear in the Assets Panel, located in the left side of the editor UI. Drag and drop them onto an artboard to begin using them.

## Importing Custom Font

For Pro customers, you can add custom fonts to be used with our Text tool. Drag and drop your `.OTF` or `.TTF` file into the editor, or use the plus button next to the Font section.

## Updating image assets

You can make updates to your images after they've been imported.

Do this by selecting the image in the Assets Panel; the asset's properties appear in the Inspector, and a "Replace" button will be available for raster assets (PNG, JPG, PSD).

Hit the replace button, and when prompted, select the updated image. You'll notice that this updates all instances of the graphic used in the file.

## Supported formats

Rive supports importing SVG (see limitations below), JSON, PNG, PSD, and JPG formats.

#### Copy and paste directly from Figma

You can use "copy as SVG" and paste it directly into the Rive editor.

#### Import Lottie file

<Note>
  Importing Lottie files is available on the Enterprise plan. [Learn more about our plans and pricing](https://rive.app/pricing).

  This workflow can introduce risks that vary across customer setups, and implementing them without our guidance can lead to issues in performance, security, or reliability. Helping customers assess and mitigate these risks takes significant time and effort, which is why this level of support is only available on Enterprise.
</Note>

You can import your Lottie animations into Rive. To get started, drag and drop your Lottie JSON file into the Rive editor. This adds it to your Assets panel.

From there, you can drag it into an existing Artboard or drag it into an empty space to create a new Artboard.

<Note>If you run into issues at runtime, you may need to convert any `Plus`, `Add`, or `Hard Mix` layer blend modes to a a blend mode supported by the Rive runtimes.</Note>

## SVG Tips

SVG is a very flexible and feature-rich format. We aim to support SVG as best we can; however, there are some features that we do not support at this stage.

Exporting files as SVG with inline style instead of CSS will work best for our importer.

When exporting from other design tools, look for the option to retain the IDs and names of your shapes when you export. This will ensure that your imported file retains the same structure and layer names. Most tools have this option, as in the Figma example below.

![Image](/images/editor/fundamentals/9a2b2c37-c330-4323-a4c6-9928fbac8d94.webp)

### Photoshop

When exporting from Photoshop, make sure you're only using vector layers. Don't convert or flatten anything to raster.

### Illustrator

When using "Save As" to export an SVG from Illustrator, set the CSS Properties in the SVG Options to "Presentation Attributes" instead of the default setting. Similarly, when using "Export As" to export an SVG from Illustrator, set Styling to "Presentation Attributes" in the SVG Options. Note that Illustrator uses the "Export As" SVG Options when copying directly from Illustrator, so if you are copy-pasting from Illustrator to the Rive editor, be sure to set Styling to "Presentation Attributes" in the SVG Options.

Additionally, disable the "Preserve Illustrator Editing Capabilities" option, as this will make your file much larger and add data that our importer does not recognize.

### Known Issues

- Embedded images are ignored. We plan to implement this.
- Gradient transforms are ignored.
  - We currently cannot provide equal support for this across our runtimes, so this is not supported.
  - However, we support linear and radial gradients, which can cover some use cases.
- Rive does not have a concept of point (pt) or millimeter (mm) sizing. An SVG that uses dimensions provided in pt or mm will have its values converted to pixels (px). Points are converted to 1.33 px, and millimeters are converted to 3.78 px.
- SVG provides `inherit` to let strokes and fills use the color of their ancestors. Rive does not support this, and any inherited color defaults to white.
- Other unsupported SVG features:
  - `stroke-dasharray` - you may see a solid stroke line instead
  - `mask` - we treat this like clipping
  - `filter`
  - `skew`

title: "Revision History"
description: "Rive saves your files automatically as you work. Even if multiple people are working on the same file at the same time, Rive tracks all changes and stores them in the Revision History."
---

## View a file's history

The Revision History can be accessed from the [Editor Menu](/editor/interface-overview/toolbar).

![Menu Revision History](/images/editor/fundamentals/revision-history-menu.gif)

## Restore a revision

Select a revision to preview it and press the Edit Current Revision button. This copies the selected revision and creates a new entry at the top of the list. This guarantees that even restoring revisions is non-destructive, and you can always go back to the previous version of the file.

![Restore a revision](/images/editor/fundamentals/revision-history-restore.gif)

## Save a Revision

From the Editor Menu, select the Create a Revision button. You'll then be prompted to name the revision.

Once the revision is created, you can restore that revision using the steps above.
